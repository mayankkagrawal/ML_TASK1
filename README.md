Description: Yes, you have heard right 60% ML projects are never implemented.We all know that Machine learning is used for finding future trend from learning of past experience this all is done by changing the weights, epochs or technically known as hyperparameter. Developer has to keep on changing these parameter for finding the best accuracy but as we know that we are living in the world of automation why we are doing this manually so i decided to automate this whole process using Devops. 
Technologies used:- Linux, Machine Learning, Docker, Git , Jenkins
